/*Create a base class with an abstract print( ) method that is
overridden in a derived class. The overridden version of the method prints the value
of an int variable defined in the derived class. At the point of definition of this
variable, give it a nonzero value. In the base-class constructor, call this method. In
main( ), create an object of the derived type, and then call its print( ) method.
Explain the results.*/
